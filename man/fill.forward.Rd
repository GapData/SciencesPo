\title{fill NA by previous cell value (fill forward)}
\usage{
fill.forward(var)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{the column that contains NAs}
}
\description{
fillForward will carry values forward from one observation to the next, filling in missing values with the previous value.
}
\note{
This is not intended for imputing missing values; it is regarded as a bad choice for missing-value imputation. The intent is, rather, to fill in \dQuote{holes}, where a value should naturally prevail from one observation to the next.
